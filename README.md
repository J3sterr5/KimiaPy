# KimiaPy
This is mini project just only to calculate something shit in Chemistry, you can use it if u want and i don't care if u change the code for your own purpose and u can also push the code on my repository then i don't need to make any code and waste my short time of life

Remember u can use this for Calculate, For Exam (Well it's Haram(i warn you)), and more...
